This repo is for keeping track of package features as we build them out. The only file that needs to be updated is the [todo.csv](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/todo/blob/main/todo.csv) file. With each update, a GitHub action runs to re-build this README file with an updated table.

```{r}
#| eval: true

source('functions.R')

build_todo_table()
```
